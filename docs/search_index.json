["introduction.html", "Chapter 1 Introduction", " Chapter 1 Introduction I decided to test the idea of road prediction on the North-Eastern German state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern (MV). MV is one of the “new” German states and former territory of the German Democratic Republic (GDR). In the 90s and 2000s after the former GDR territories joined the Federal Republic of Germany a lot of development projects were carried out in the new states to promote “flourishing landscapes”. Most notably in MV the motorway A20 (so-called Baltic Sea motorway) was built. I only rely on Landsat images of Landsat 4 and higher because the resolution on Landsat 1-3 is not high enough. Landsat 4 started in 1982 and the resolution for 5 of the 7 band is 30 square meters at the equator. "],

My approach was to extract the identifier of the images that I want to download and then feed them into the USGS website. This way a bulk download is possible. The necessary file to identify the images can be downloaded from USGS. I only care about pictures taken between June and August by Landsat 5 which operated between 1985 and 2011. The reason is that the sizes of the images are large, including scences from the whole year means that the reflected colors change and thus, more images are necessary to train the algorithm. Additionally, clouds block the view and I assume that there are less clouds in the summer than in the winter, which increases the number of useable scenes. 3.1 Locating the scenes First, I identify the PATH and the ROW which are necessery to identify the scenes. wrs2&lt;-readOGR(&quot;data/spatial/wrs2/wrs2_descending.shp&quot;, verbose=FALSE) pol_extent2 &lt;- as(pol_extent,&quot;Spatial&quot;) %&gt;% SpatialPolygonsDataFrame(data=data.frame(x=1)) mv_wrs2 &lt;- wrs2[which(!is.na(over(wrs2,pol_extent2,returnList =FALSE))),] mv_wrs2 %&gt;% st_as_sf() %&gt;% ggplot() + geom_sf(data=mv) + geom_sf(fill=NA) Figure 3.1: MV with scenes. With the PATH and ROW numbers (Table 3.1), I turned to the eartexplorer website to search for the images. Instead of downloading the images, which are around 2 GB each, I extracted the meta file (Figure 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4). scenes &lt;- wrs2@data[which(!is.na(over(wrs2,pol_extent2,returnList =FALSE))),c(&quot;PATH&quot;,&quot;ROW&quot;)] data.frame(PATH = c(min(scenes$PATH),max(scenes$PATH)), ROW = c(min(scenes$ROW),max(scenes$ROW)),row.names = c(&quot;Min&quot;,&quot;Max&quot;)) %&gt;% kable(cap=&quot;PATH and ROW to retrieve scene list from Earthexplorer.&quot;) Table 3.1: PATH and ROW to retrieve scene list from Earthexplorer.

Figure 3.4: Screenshot of selecting Landsat 4-5 from Earthexplorer. 3.2 Reducing the scenes The metadata can be read it and analyzed on its own. First, I only select images from Landsat 5 between June and August. I then calculate the lowest cloud coverage for each scene in each year. Third, I calculate the overal maximum of the lowest yearly coverages and the mean cloud coverare for each scene (Table 3.2). It turns out that scene 194@22 and 194@23 have the most favorable numbers and cover most of the territory of MV (Figure 3.5) images_df &lt;- read.csv(&quot;data/rectangular/scene_list/LSR_LANDSAT_TM_C1_279839.csv&quot;) %&gt;% mutate(month = strsplit(Acquisition.Date,&quot;/&quot;) %&gt;% lapply(`[[`,2) %&gt;% unlist() %&gt;% as.numeric(), year = strsplit(Acquisition.Date,&quot;/&quot;) %&gt;% lapply(`[[`,1) %&gt;% unlist() %&gt;% as.numeric(), satelitte = strsplit(Landsat.Product.Identifier,&quot;_&quot;) %&gt;% lapply(`[[`,1) %&gt;% unlist(), PATHROW = strsplit(Landsat.Product.Identifier,&quot;_&quot;) %&gt;% lapply(`[[`,3) %&gt;% unlist()) %&gt;% mutate(PATH = substr(PATHROW,1,3) %&gt;% as.numeric(), ROW = substr(PATHROW,4,6) %&gt;% as.numeric()) %&gt;% filter(month &gt; 6 &amp; month &lt; 9) %&gt;% filter(satelitte == &quot;LT05&quot;) exp &lt;- images_df %&gt;% expand(year,PATH,ROW) exp$minimum_cloud_cover &lt;- apply(exp,1,function(x) { f1 &lt;- images_df %&gt;% filter(year == x[1]&amp; PATH == x[2]&amp; ROW == x[3]) if (nrow(f1) == 0) return(NA) f1 %$% Land.Cloud.Cover %&gt;% min }) exp %&gt;% mutate(PATHROW=paste0(PATH,&quot;@&quot;,ROW)) %&gt;% group_by(PATHROW) %&gt;% summarise(`Maximum of yearly minimum cloud cover`=max(minimum_cloud_cover,na.rm=TRUE), `Mean Cloud Cover`=round(mean(minimum_cloud_cover,na.rm=TRUE),2)) %&gt;% kable(caption = &quot;Maximum and mean cloud cover for different scenes.&quot;) Table 3.2: Maximum and mean cloud cover for different scenes.
